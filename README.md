# 🌤️ Weather Temperature Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict the **Maximum Temperature** based on the **Minimum Temperature** using a weather dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a linear regression model that can:
- Understand the correlation between minimum and maximum daily temperatures
- Predict maximum temperatures from minimum temperatures
- Visualize the data and model performance

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: `Summary of Weather.csv`
- Features used:
  - `MinTemp` — Minimum daily temperature
  - `MaxTemp` — Maximum daily temperature
