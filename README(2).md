# PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Python. It uses a continuous target variable dataset to predict an outcome based on various features, implementing common techniques such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `Task2.ipynb`: The main notebook file that contains the code for the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding the project structure, steps, and requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a continuous variable dataset suitable for linear regression. The target variable is predicted based on one or more independent features. If you need a dataset, suitable options include:
- **California Housing Dataset**
- **Diabetes Dataset**
- **Advertising Dataset**
  
(You may download these from online sources like `sklearn.datasets` or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.)

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset and explore it to understand the features and target variable.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values if necessary.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test data using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
6. **Visualization**: 
   - Plot the regression line on the training data to understand the model’s fit.
   - Compare actual vs. predicted values on the test data to assess the model’s accuracy.

## Key Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Indicates the average squared error between the predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Shows the percentage of variance explained by the model. Higher values (close to 1) suggest a better fit.

## Results

The results section provides insights into the model's accuracy and any observations about the data or model performance. For example:
- Training MSE and R-squared values.
- Testing MSE and R-squared values.
- Any noted trends, patterns, or outliers in the data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression for predictive modeling on a continuous variable dataset. Further improvements can include experimenting with polynomial regression, regularization techniques, or feature engineering to enhance model performance.
